# Edit-That-Text

###This app is a text editor with JavaScript syntax highlighting, which can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA). When you type in the editor, your input is saved to a local database, so you can close the app and your work will still be there when you come back. You can install the app to your device by clicking the "install" button, which is only enabled when your browser supports the installation of PWAs. When installed, the app can work offline, making your notes accessible even without an internet connection. The use of a service worker ensures the offline functionality and the prompt install to the home screen. Finally, the user interface and features are designed to be simple and intuitive for an enhanced user experience.
